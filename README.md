# Cyber-Physical Systems Project

## Grupo 1 - Diogo Fernandes 49992, Paulo Alvares 49460

This project main goal is to design and develop a real-time System, in this case, an horizontal speed auto-pilot for an aircraft in cruise mode.

This project is divised in four main components:
- Data Visualization (External Application);
- Flight Data Recorder (Non Real-time module);
- Flight Management Computer (Real-time Module);
- Control Algorithm (Real-time/Non Real-time module).

### Data Visualization (External)

This module is responsible to display information from the Flight Data Recorder in a plot to summarize the evolution of the aircraft speed

### Flight Data Recorder (NRT)
This module work like an "aircraft blackbox" and so, it stores all the data related with the aircraft's parameters, in this case, speed and thrust data.

### Flight Management Computer (RT)

### Control Algorithm (RT/NRT)
